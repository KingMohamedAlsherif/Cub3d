## Progress So Far (40-60% Complete)
We've implemented the core functionality of the cub3d project:
- Ray casting algorithm for 3D rendering
- Basic player movement and rotation controls
- Map navigation with collision detection
- Simple 3D rendering engine

## Remaining Work Distribution

### Member A: Maps, Parsing, and Player Controls (30%)
**Tasks**:
1. **Map Parsing** (Days 1-2):
   - Implement functions to read and extract data from the .cub file.
   - Parse textures, colors, and map structure from the configuration file.

2. **Map Validation** (Day 3):
   - Validate the map structure to ensure it is enclosed and error-free.
   - Implement checks for valid syntax and configuration.

3. **Player Controls Enhancement** (Day 4):
   - Add additional movement features (sprinting, looking up/down).
   - Improve collision detection accuracy.

4. **Error Handling** (Day 5):
   - Implement comprehensive error checking for file operations and invalid configurations.
   - Provide meaningful error messages for common issues.

5. **Documentation** (Day 6):
   - Document the map format and configuration options.
   - Write usage instructions for the program.

### Member B: Rendering, Textures, and Math (30%)
**Tasks**:
1. **Texture Mapping** (Days 1-2):
   - Implement texture loading from files specified in the .cub file.
   - Apply textures to walls, floor, and ceiling.
   - Ensure proper texture alignment and scaling.

2. **Sprite Rendering** (Day 3):
   - Implement sprite rendering for objects in the map.
   - Calculate sprite positions and sizes based on distance from the player.

3. **Rendering Optimization** (Day 4):
   - Optimize rendering performance for smoother gameplay.
   - Implement view bobbing for immersive experience.

4. **Math Utilities** (Day 5):
   - Implement additional mathematical functions needed for calculations.
   - Refine ray casting and distance calculations for accuracy.

5. **Final Integration and Testing** (Day 6):
   - Integrate all components and ensure they work together seamlessly.
   - Test the complete implementation with various maps.
