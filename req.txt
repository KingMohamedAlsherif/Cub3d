Here is the list of variables that need to be filled in the t_game struct and the other structs inside it, in the correct order:

t_game Struct
mlx_ptr (pointer to the MLX instance)
win_ptr (pointer to the MLX window)
file (of type t_file)
file_arr (array of strings representing the file content)
filepath_len (length of the file path)
stage (current stage of parsing or processing)
file_len (number of lines in the file)
texture (of type t_txtrs)
no (pointer to north texture data, t_txtdata)
so (pointer to south texture data, t_txtdata)
we (pointer to west texture data, t_txtdata)
ea (pointer to east texture data, t_txtdata)
f_arr[3] (RGB array for floor color)
c_arr[3] (RGB array for ceiling color)
f_color (final floor color in RGB format)
c_color (final ceiling color in RGB format)
map (pointer to t_map)
map_arr (2D array of characters representing the map)
map_width (width of the map)
map_height (height of the map)
map_st (start index of the map in the file)
map_end (end index of the map in the file)
p_x (player's x-coordinate in the map)
p_y (player's y-coordinate in the map)
plyr_direction (player's initial direction)
player (pointer to t_player)
plyr_x (player's x-coordinate in the game world)
plyr_y (player's y-coordinate in the game world)
plyr_angle (player's angle of view)
fov_rd (field of view in radians)
rot_flag (rotation flag)
r_l (rotation left/right flag)
u_d (movement up/down flag)
direction (player's movement direction)
img (pointer to t_img)
background_img (pointer to the background image)
wall_img (pointer to the wall image)
img (pointer to the current image)
addr (address of the image data)
pixel (pointer to the pixel data)
bpp (bits per pixel)
line_len (length of a line in the image)
endian (endianness of the image)
tx_width (texture width)
tx_height (texture height)
ray (pointer to t_ray)
indx (index of the ray)
ray_angle (angle of the ray)
hor_x (horizontal intersection x-coordinate)
hor_y (horizontal intersection y-coordinate)
ver_x (vertical intersection x-coordinate)
ver_y (vertical intersection y-coordinate)
distance (distance to the wall hit)
wall_flag (flag indicating the type of wall hit)
txtrs (pointer to t_txtrs)
Same fields as texture above.
Summary of Structs Inside t_game
t_file: Handles file-related data.
t_txtrs: Manages texture data.
t_map: Stores map-related data.
t_player: Contains player-related data.
t_img: Handles image-related data.
t_ray: Manages raycasting data.
This is the order in which the variables should be filled to ensure proper initialization of the t_game struct and its dependencies.
